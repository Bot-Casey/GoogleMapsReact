# Goal of this Repo
The end goal would to be able to plot a bunch of locations using a predefined REST API, json or shape file. Depending on data in said file, there could be data info graphics sprinkled in. 

# Building 

You can run a clone and build this repo immediately. However, you will have some functionality stipped without using a Google Maps API key. You can store this in a .env file and then build the app to see custom styling and other functions.
